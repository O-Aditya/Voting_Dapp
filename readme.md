## Installation ⚙️
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Truffle: `npm install -g truffle`
- Ganache (local blockchain)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
   cd <PROJECT_NAME>

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
  npm install
  
3. Start a local blockchain with Ganache

4. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset

## Usage 🚀
1. Voter Registration:

- Connect your wallet (MetaMask).

- Admins can authorize voter addresses.

2. Create a Ballot:

- Admins define election parameters (candidates, duration).

3. Cast a Vote:

- Voters select a candidate and submit the transaction.

4. View Results:

- Real-time results displayed after the election ends.

## Smart Contracts 📜
